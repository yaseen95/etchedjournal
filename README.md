# Etched Journal
A journal where entries are "etched" in stone. That's the idea anyway.

A few years ago I started journaling and I set a rule where I would try my best not to press
backspace. It feels like a cool enough idea to implement.

## Key Features
* All journal entries are encrypted on the client side
* After {x} seconds, entries cannot be edited
